🎵 Music Player Streaming Engine

A modular Music Player Streaming Engine built using Object-Oriented Design principles and multiple Design Patterns.
The system simulates the backend logic of a modern music streaming platform, allowing flexible playback strategies, device connectivity, playlist management, and simplified interaction with complex subsystems.

This project demonstrates Low-Level System Design (LLD) concepts and design pattern implementations commonly used in scalable software systems.

🚀 Features

🎧 Playlist Management

🔀 Multiple Playback Strategies

📡 Device Connectivity (Bluetooth, speakers, etc.)

🎼 Song Streaming Simulation

🧠 Modular Architecture using Design Patterns

🧩 Simplified interface using Facade

⚡ Command-based action execution (Play, Pause, Next, etc.)

The Facade acts as the main entry point that coordinates all subsystems.

🧠 Design Patterns Implemented
1️⃣ Strategy Pattern

Used to support different song playback strategies.

Playback modes include:

Sequential Play

Random Play

Custom Queue Play

This allows the system to switch playback behavior dynamically at runtime.

Example:

PlayStrategy
   ├── SequentialPlay
   ├── RandomPlay
   └── CustomQueuePlay
2️⃣ Factory Pattern

Used to create device objects dynamically without exposing creation logic.

Supported devices may include:

Bluetooth Speaker

Wired Headphones

Smart Speaker

External Audio Device

Example:

DeviceFactory → createDevice(type)
3️⃣ Adapter Pattern

Used to integrate external or third-party audio devices whose interfaces differ from the internal player interface.

The adapter converts external APIs into a common device interface so the player can interact with them seamlessly.

4️⃣ Singleton Pattern

Ensures that only one instance of core managers exists in the system.

Singleton is used for:

PlaylistManager

DeviceManager

StreamingEngine

Benefits:

Global access

Controlled resource usage

Consistent system state

5️⃣ Facade Pattern

Provides a simplified interface to interact with complex subsystems.

Instead of interacting with multiple managers directly, the client communicates through:

MusicSystemFacade

Example:

musicFacade.playSong("SongName");

The facade internally coordinates:

Playlist Manager

Device Manager

Streaming Engine

Player

6️⃣ Command Pattern

Encapsulates actions as command objects, allowing flexible command execution.

Commands include:

PlaySongCommand

PauseSongCommand

NextSongCommand

PreviousSongCommand

Flow:

User → UI Button → Command → MusicPlayer

Benefits:

Decouples request sender and receiver

Enables command queuing

Supports undo/redo operations
